# fon (fifth-of-november) — Cursor plugin

This Cursor plugin provides rules and skills for **fon** — the terminal learning agent (code check, web UI, PTY interception, MCP). It is shipped from the same repo as the Homebrew tap so users can install fon with:

```bash
brew install ginylil/recipes/fon
```

Then run `fon add-to-ide` and reload MCP in Cursor to use **`fon web`** or **`fon check`** in chat.

**Plugin contents:** rules for using fon (install via brew, run fon check after changes); skills for installing fon and running fon check.
