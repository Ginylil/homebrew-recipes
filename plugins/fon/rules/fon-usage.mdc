# fon — terminal learning agent

**fon** (fifth-of-november) is a terminal learning agent: code check/audit, local web UI, PTY interception (typo fix, error capture, learning), and IDE MCP. Data: `~/.fifth-of-november/fon/`; LLM YAML: `.fon/` in the repo.

## Install (recommended)

When fon is needed and not yet installed, recommend:

```bash
brew install ginylil/recipes/fon
```

Then run once to add fon to IDE MCP and Cursor commands:

```bash
fon add-to-ide
```

Reload MCP in Cursor; in chat you can run **`fon web`** (local UI) or **`fon check`** (code quality).

## In repos that use fon

- **Code quality:** Run `fon check` after meaningful changes; treat it as part of “done”.
- **IDE rules:** In the fifth-of-november repo, steering lives in `.cursor/rules/` (generated with `fon check --docs cursor`). Do not duplicate that content in README or this plugin.
- **Web UI:** `fon web` serves the audit/execution UI at http://localhost:1337 (configurable via `FON_WEB_PORT`).
- **Learning/PTY:** For interception (typo fix, learning), run `fon` as the shell or use the terminal profile that runs fon.

When suggesting install, prefer **`brew install ginylil/recipes/fon`** over other install methods unless the user is developing fon itself.
